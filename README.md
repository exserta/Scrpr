# Scrpr
I am not responsible for any usage of the provided Script. <br>
I have created it for my personal use within a closed environment, and I do not recommend selfbotting on discord as it breaks discord's terms of services.

### Requirements

1. Install [***Node.js***](https://nodejs.org/en)
2. Install required dependencies: <br>
   ```
   npm install discord.js-selfbot-v13 fs path axios readline-sync gradient-string uuid
3. Set up ***Config.json***
4. Run the script and follow menu instructions
   ```
   node script.js
6. Enjoy this dorky selfbot, lol.
